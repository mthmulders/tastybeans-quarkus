## :goal_net: Goals

This sample achieves the following goals:

* Demonstrate how to implement 12-factor cloud-native applications in Java with Quarkus.
* Demonstrate how to integrate microservices with a machine-learning environment.

## :triangular_flag_on_post: Status

This sample is a work in progress and by no means complete. Currently, only the
microservices are available in the solution. Also, not all planned functionality
is in the microservices yet.

## :computer: System requirements

Please make sure you have the following tools available:

* Java 19 SDK
* Docker

## :rocket: Getting started

- Run `quarkus dev` in each of the folders.

## :construction_worker: Developing

Each server can be run in dev-mode independently. Navigate into the directory and run `quarkus dev` to start
the service in dev mode.
